The application for administrative purposes and creating technical project documentation enables users to efficiently manage projects. Alongside features such as creating and tracking project schedules, assigning tasks to teams, maintaining records of resources and expenses, and generating technical documents such as specifications, diagrams, and reports, it also allows for archiving files to a local server. This integration ensures secure storage and easy retrieval of relevant documents, further facilitating project management. Note: I developed the application for the company I worked for, customizing it to fit the team's specific needs and project management processes.
